“I believe in learning not study” –  Chalitta S.<br>
Hello, World!. I'm Chalitta. I've been coding for a while so, let me clarify about my education first and later with attitude + opinion.<br> 
I have to confess that I’ve been transferred 4 Universities with different majors, in Thai we call it “Sew”,”ซิ่ว” first, I studied at the Faculty of Forestry and Social Sciences(Psychology) at Kasetsart University, second at the Faculty of Communication Art – Visual Art at Assumption University and third, the Faculty of Architecture – Innovation Design at Rangsit University and Finally at The Institute of International Studied at Ramkhamhaeng University with BA Mass Communication-Art, Major in TV and Radio Broadcasting and Minor in Journalism. I found good education does exist but, not in the system as the school didn’t teach anything mandatory much about life therefore, self-learning is necessary for me even-though I achieved Bachelor Degree at the end. By the way, I have to complete it because of the social norm in Thailand especially my parents, they’re both worked for the government and conserved about education.
After Graduated, I’ve worked in many industries with different job scopes and run my freelance projects from time to time. By the way, during my career life, I found that I love working with thinking type of people more than emotional type of people as my MBTI test is clearly showed that I’m thinker not feeler but, in my previous careers and environments, I tended to deal with human emotions more than logical thinking, may be my position was not fit right then I reconsidered myself, where should I go next as my personality is completely unfit with my previous careers(except SAP master data position), I researched my personality and interests then found that I like working with computer and analyzing several topics, I enjoy exploring myself to domestic and global knowledge where I can leverage my potential higher. I sometimes isolated myself for self-study and most of all, I like to challenge and develop myself unstoppable; nevertheless, I think it’s not too late as long as I’m alive (Covid-19 helped me to realize that human could die easily). Many people told me that it’s too late for them to change career or try a new thing but I realized that I want to change my career path to tech industry or related industries like business or market research. I found my personality and passions fit right well to them. Above are all of my current attitude + opinion with career and related topics. I wish you could understand my clarifications after read all above and if you interested to let me join your team, you can download my resume as below. Thank you.
